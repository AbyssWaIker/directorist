Go to Directory Listings >> Directorist settings and make sure you have added all the pages with correct shortcodes to the settings under pages,links&views settings.

In that case, you just need to click save changes) Then you can add google map api key if you want to display map on the listing. Checkout other settings and customize them as  you like. Then save the changes.

Now Go to Directory Listings >> Add New Listing to add your listing items. After adding your desired number of listings, you can check your website.
