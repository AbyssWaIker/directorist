    <h2>Upgrade Database</h2>
    <p style="background:#ffffff; padding: 20px; line-height: 24px;">If you are an existing user of the directorist or your listing is not showing properly on your website, then you should upgrade your old listings to display the listing data properly. There has been a huge change in the data storage for implementing export & import feature. So, this upgrade will make your website compatible with the latest directorist with import & export feature. Thank you. </p>

    <p><span style="color: red; font-size: 14px">*Please do not leave the page after clicking the upgrade button. Wait for a moment until you see a success message.</span></p>
